* Restructured Non-Spectral Missing Fish handler to consolidate unoptimized code.

* Users can now skip Bait Restock by setting the Threshold or Amount to 0. While this is inadvisable, it was requested as an option. Failure to have the appropriate bait in your inventory can lead to issues with trying to fish. Always ensure you have an adequate amount of bait.

---------

* Fixed bug with using Patience II. It wasn't checking to see if the Patience aura was active and kept using Patience II. Whoops!

* Tightened up Bite Timer timings to be closer to what appears in-game for the Fish Timer found in the Gather Buddy Dalamud Plugin. (Hopefully)

* Added Bite Timer to Open World Fishing as a test of the tighter timings.

* Moved Bait Restock Threshold and Bait Restock Amount into the settings list instead of being hard coded to 150 and 500 respectively.

---------

* Added bait switching logic to catch all of the spectral fish when Fish Priority is set to "Fishing Log".

* Added special condition handling for catching spectral blues. Some of them require the use of Patience, so Patience II is used where possible. If users don't have Patience II, it will use Patience instead. This works by tracking all of the fish caught for the current "round" and quantifying certain fish types. In case of mooching, it will use the required bait to catch the mooching fish. Example is Placodus, which requires you to mooch a trollfish from a Rothlyt Mussle, and then you can mooch Placodus from a Rothlyt Mussle.

* If you are attempting to complete your fishing log, Double Hooks will NOT happen.

---------

* Added basic open-world fishing assistance. Go to a fishing spot, equip the right bait and then cast. The bot will take over from there until you use the quit ability, run out of bait, or the boat triggers and becomes available. This might be enhanced more in the future. This was added to help fill out the fishing log while waiting for the boat. The bot will mooch when available, use Thaliak's Favor, and hook when ready. It does not use cordials, double hook, or other abilities. There is a slight delay between re-casting to give users the ability use other skills such as Fish Eyes.

* Started implementation of Zeke's rules for points. Allowing for a +/- 1 second margin of error in bite times.

* Cleaned up some redundant checks in the code.

* Corrected an issue where if you start the bot in the middle of an Ocean Trip, it would either do nothing, or get the wrong time of day. This caused the bot to select the incorrect bait and use incorrect logic.

* Added bait switching for all Non-Spectral fish when Fish Priority is set to "Fishing Log". The Spectral version of this is coming soon, as there are a lot of conditions to check.

* Fixed an issue with using Cordials.

* Fixed an issue with Angler's Art triggering during Non-Spectral events when stacks are less than 10.

* Added try/catch around IO operations for loading BoatOrder.json and lisbeth-resume.json files with logging to the RebornBuddy console.

* Additional magic numbers removed from PassTheTime.cs.

* Added a setting for Late Boat Queues. If set to true, the bot base will wait until the 13th minute to queue up for the boat. If set to false, the bot base will queue up as soon as the boat is available. Late Boat Queues lead to higher chances of being on the boat alone, which will lead to potentially higher point gains and easier percentage boosts.

Completed:
* Basic handling of parties. If you're in a party and not a party leader, you'll stand near Dryskthota and wait for the Commence dialog to pop. If the party is a Cross Realm party, nothing further will happen and you will not queue up. If it is a local party and you are the party leader, it will check that all party members are nearby and targetable before queueing up the party.

* Improved Cordials further. During spectral events, if the difference between your current GP and your max GP is 400 or greater, a cordial will be used.  If it is not a spectral event and the difference between your current GP and max GP is 400 or greater, and your current GP is 25% or less of your max GP, then a cordial will be use.

* Added a setting for Full GP Action. If it is a Non-Spectral event and you're within 100GP of your max GP, will perform the action chosen if you are able to use it and have enough GP to cover the use. Current abilities added are Chum and Double Hook.

* Changed Ocean Food setting from a boolean to a list of available foods. If inventory is low (less than 10) for the selected food, Lisbeth will attempt to craft 40 more.

* Will now use Thaliak's Favor if you are 200GP or more below your maximum GP value and the Spectral event is active or you have 10 stacks of Angler's Art.  Will only trigger if you are able to cast Thaliak's Favor (Requires at least 3 Angler's Art stacks).

* Fix for potential crash scenario - When looking at the results screen, there is a 12 second sleep. What if the user clicks the button on the results screen before the botbase does? Can potentially make things bad. Adds a second check to ensure the results window is still not null (this is sloppy and needs to be refined later).

* FEATURES REMOVED: Exchange for Materia, Empty Gatherer Scrips, Craft Mats. All of these use Lisbeth to Exchange with a scrip vendor, and that code just doesn't work right now. Craft Mats currently only exchanges for Immutable Solution's. This may be expanded and re-enabled in the future.

Completed:
* Removed "Magic Numbers" from the code to make it easier to read. Definitions can be found in OceanFishing.cs and FFXIV_Definitions.cs.

* Restructured multiple segments of code to be more readable instead of being entirely inline. Some instances were left alone.

* Reduced the amount of log messages to the RebornBuddy console, added more log messages where it made sense.

* Added handling for HQ or Normal Crab Cakes, as well as HQ Peppered Popotoes or normal Peppered Popotoes (whichever is in the inventory). Ocean Trip will try to use HQ over regular, starting with Crab Cakes. If you don't have any Crab Cakes, it will look for Peppered Popotoes.

* Updated Cordial logic to check for the correct one to use (Hi-Cordial, Cordial, Watered Cordial). Priority is given to Hi-Cordials, followed by Cordials, and lastly Watered Cordials. Whichever is in your inventory.

* Changed timing of some of the events to occur at the correct times instead of 10+ minutes after.

* Removed the Missing Ocean Fish list and replaced it with the total number of missing ocean fish. Related messages now only appear at the start of Ocean Trip, and it refreshes after the results screen from a trip.

* Fixed an issue that caused FFXIV to crash due to a conflict between OceanTrip and Dalamud Plugins. This may have been a unique situation to my own personal use case.

* If you start Ocean Trip and it's 10 minutes after the duty becomes available (IE: 2:10PM), the BotBase will automatically skip the current round and wait the 1 hour and 50 minutes (or whatever remains) until the next boat trip. You can override this by talking to Dryskthota and queueing up, then starting the bot while loading into the instance. The reasoning for this is that not everyone may make it in time.

* Once you finish a round of fishing, it will display how much time there is until the next ocean trip.


Want To Do:
* Lisbeth is killed only if focus is on points, or if it's on Fishing Log and a legendary is missing. This should be adapted to also check if the user is missing ANY fish, and not just legendaries. Perhaps an additional setting option?

* Food handling needs to be better and allow for more than just hard coded checks. Maybe a selectable option in Settings?

* Retaining option loves to keep looping over the retainers even if it's not time yet. Need to keep track fo the lowest retainer timer and keep it memorized while the bot is active when set to True.

* A good fisher should never be 100% GP all the time. Need to add additional ability use (IE: Chum) when at full GP and not in Spectral. GP Regen should always be going.


Known Issues:
* If you are in a group, there may be issues with registering for the boat.

* If you start the bot mid-trip, it may not like that and appear unresponsive.

* Current focus tries to get Blues if they are missing, regardless of points setting. This causes the incorrect bait to be used in some circumstances where the user may want to prefer going for additional points. This likely won't be fixed, so this is documentation for posterity.
